this is Ettore (pic of ettore)
he (she?) is 4 years old as christmast 2014, has a black spot on the sone, and each summer i bring him (her?) to the sea with me
he lives happly in this aquarium, but now time has come to move to a new home.

i decided to build a 416mm x 516mm x 400mm aquarium with 8mm glass, to fit a space to the side of my bed.
(pic of glass)
the glass will be glued with jbl aquasil silicon (?), piece by piece, and the pieces will be kept together 24 hours with the aide od two right angle clamps
(pics) of clamps)
is important to clean the contact surfaces, otherwise the silicone will not hold. for the job i bought 80mil of aquasil, i hope it will be enough

right now i did the first joint. as with everything, the chances to get it right the first time are slim, but as the saying goes "measure twice to drill only once", i measured everything twice and tryied the movement a couple of times. Hopefully tomorrow the joint will be ok
